Football Play Tracker

Developed by Hernan Le

Using the Godot game engine (version 4.x)

This program allows the user to set up different plays ran by football teams and input information about the play (quarter, down, yards to go, yards advanced, etc).
By building a collection of different plays, the user can use the program to identify a team's strengths and weaknesses.
